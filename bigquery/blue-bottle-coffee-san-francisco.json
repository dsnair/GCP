Too bad I won't be in Hayes Valley as often anymore but I will definitely make the extra mile happen if I want some good stuff!This location is seriously a hole-in-the-wall where it's in a narrow street looking like an alleyway. It's rare people linger around because it's more of a grab-n-go place with rocks and benches to hang out at. I've tried their latte, mocha, and New Orleans iced coffee. Every drink I've had here has never disappointed! Always fast and friendly staff people here. Also tried their olive oil shortbread; nothing to die for, but worth trying if you're into something different. All their other pastries look so yummy.Coffee is a little pricey for a small cup, but quality over quantity! Great little treat once in a while to have :)"

Such a cute location that's provides a great place to people (and dog) watch, a little park you can walk around, and close to neighborhood gems you can window shop while taking a stroll.It's unlikely you won't find this place since there's always a line, finding the end of the line will probably be more challenging! Just in case there isn't a line, it's in an alley in a garage that's the size of a shoebox. Their pound cake is pretty good paired with a latte. They sell beans to go. I made French press for a week with them. Parking here is pretty sparse, and most streets have street cleaning. Park at your own risk!"

		"content": "Although there's no indoor cafe and not much outside seating - it's the best coffee I've ever had (sorry Portland, it's true). That's why there's a continuous line (which goes fairly fast) at their open-air walk up shop. It's in a tiny alley way, next to a very noticeable corset shop. After your pick up your delicious Mocha (my fave), you can walk around the corner to a gluten free French macaroon shop or go shopping at all the fun boutiques in the area. This is the only coffee I've drank that didn't have any acidic taste or acidic effects on my stomach. I failed to ask if the beans are fair trade or locally roasted. Staff was helpful and friendly. The next-to-none parking shouldn't factor into a review for this shop, because parking in the whole city is awful. This little shop can't be dinged for what every other business has a challenge with, and cannot change. I walked 10 blocks to get here on a nice day. Ride your bike or have uber pick you up - it's worth the trouble."

		"content": "Good lord this is good coffee! I asked what the difference was between Cafe au Lait and Latte since both were on the menu. I always thought they were the French and Italian versions of the same thing. They told me that a Cafe au Lait is made with drip coffee and some milk whereas a Latte is made with espresso and a lot of milk. So not so much coffee. Seeing as I was at Blue Bottle, it seemed a horrific waste to buy milk but it was morning so I opted for the $4 Cafe au Lait. It looked like a latte with a foamy top but it was delightful deliciousness. Like the perfect amount of coffee and milk married together in creamy harmony. I sat in the tiny park across the way and watched an even tinier mouse gather food and take it to it's tiny underground nest. By the time my friend joined me, a huge line had formed. 9 AM seems to be the tipping point on a Saturday morning. We lined up to get her a coffee and I ended up getting ANOTHER one! It was so good. We shared a delicious ginger molasses cookie made with real fresh ginger and not too much sugar and then strolled over to the square to look at the sculpture. Pretty much a perfect morning."

It was light and good. Not a fan of the mocha. Not a fan of mochas in general. Didn't get a chance to try anything else since I was here on a short visit.

There are usually a couple people hanging around by it, and for good reason! While their menu is small, their service is always friendly and very fast, having my order ready before I even finish paying!You can't go wrong with their New Orleans Iced Coffee or their Caffe Mocha, rich in TCHO chocolate!

But it works!I slurped up all of my NEW ORLEANS ICED COFFEE while waiting for them to finish making a cafe latte that was also part of my order. That is how good it is. I used almond milk in mine and the result was so creamy, just sugary enough and so very drinkable. The CAFE LATTE was straightforward and the latte art was gorgeous. My hand shook carrying it over to the car for the others to see before capping it, which was quite the challenge but this beauty needed to be appreciated. I even took a one-handed picture along the way. I was almost inclined to grab a bag of their homemade granola or a tiny baked good, but after a day of gluttony, I reasoned that experiencing the prized iced coffee was enough."

The cashier warned me that this is equivalent to 3 shots of espresso and I was like, no worries! Oji is a Japanese-style code Brewer coffee. They drip this overnight for around 24 hours before they serve it. Therefore, the flavors are strong and dense. The taste was more acidity than chocolatey. And boy did this coffee wake me up! I ended up staying up until 2am that night. I wish there is a blue bottle coffee shop in Boston! I would definitely go back and try other drinks on their menu!"

Theirs is very good, but i don't know if it was life changing as some say. You still have to come and pop that bubble before you move on of course :)$4.50 for a small Latte. Most drinks around that price. There's only one size, no room for mistakes. The shop is in a cute alley, you won't see it by driving by on Gough St... Parking nearby is hard, $2/hr which meant my coffee was technically $6.50 haha. Walk down the street to Patricias Green little park. It's so hipster you'll hate yourself for liking it."

It feels like it's a pop-up in the middle of an alley but that alley is a small street, Linden St. It's just a few steps from the Hayes Valley shopping area around the corner from Proxy Park.  The ladies behind the counter were friendly and efficient, asking for my order with people in front of me before I even reached the cashier. This day I opted for New Orleans Iced Coffee with Almond Milk. Cool satisfaction, just sliding down my throat. Strong, bold and sweet, with enough cream to mellow out the strong beans but not so much to mute it's natural essence. Tough choices in this world.  Ritual Coffee and Blue Bottle all within a few steps of each other. Flip coin to pick and live with it. San Francisco is that kind of place. But if you're looking for iced coffee, I think Blue Bottle has the slight edge."

Wait hold up lets rewind, I didn't get to tell my story yet.  My friend wanted to get his car detailed at a shop close by and asked me to drive him back so I reluctantly agreed. We drove there and the navigation took me past linden street and I noticed the shop. I pulled round the street and parked and walked there. There were a handful of people but the line moved quickly and the employees were plenty nice. They asked what I wanted and originally I wanted a cappuccino, you apparently can't take that to go so I settled for 2 caffe mochas, one for me and one for my friend. Paid and hung around for a bit and we got our coffee. It smelled so wonderful, and they put whatever coffee art they were able to make on top of it. Strong delicious coffee with semisweet tcho chocolate in the caffe mocha, mmmmm delicious."

My friend spotted me for a New Orleans and Affogato, which were both great but towards the bottom of the drinks are where all the shot and bitterness lies, so be wary of that. The barista put whole milk in my New Orleans, which I was able to pick up the creamy sweet texture in my drink, while the Affogato  was served with extremely sweet ice cream and was not well balanced enough with the espresso shot.Parking, obviously, is definitely a b****, as well as the parking meter. One quarter basically gives you, like, 3 extra minutes. Rip off! Overall, I had a great time here - didn't have a long wait, outdoor seating was the best, friendly and knowledgeable service, and great vibe."

		"content": "One of the most popular names for coffee in the city, and for good reason. Every location I've been to provides the same great service, barista expertise and consistent production of quality coffee. Where Blue Bottle slightly edges out its competition is in their iced coffee. Their New Orleans, while slightly too sweet for my own tastes, stands out against the competition for being decadently creamy with a strong coffee presence. Their drip coffees and lattes, additionally, are no slouch either. The Three Africans is another favorite of mine when I opt for the black coffee option. Strong and earthyThis location in particular boasts one of the nicest locations in the city. Located out of what looks to be a garage in an alleyway, it's only blocks away from linden park (that strip of grass in the middle of Hayes Valley) which provides for some great people-watching, restaurant hopping and boutique shopping."

BBC is located in a small, unassuming garage front on Linden (in the alley).  I ordered the New Orleans iced coffee. I typically order my coffee in much stronger form, but since I wasn't sure how long it would take me to get back to BBC, I decided to try the star of the menu (via yelp reviews). I couldn't have been more pleased--the flavors were good, strong and clean--most importantly, nice and simple. It's good to see coffee (and the people who love it) moving away from milkshakes and sugary garbage (although this was never really an issue in SF proper).    The baristas were so nice and quick. I was in and out within 5 minutes, despite a lengthy-looking line.  Don't quote me, but I believe they take payment via iPad (like most other places).  The other patrons were also nice--friendly dog folks.  In short, I can see why people love BBC.

Fanfare around the city's trendy hotspots is really getting to be like the emperor's new clothes for me, all hype with little substance. So for just this level of coffee and price, I feel they should at least provide some place to sit down, but most of Blue Bottles are savvy on space and high traffic. Not worth the price (and the slight snobby service I detected) this morning. There's no bright customer service, just disaffected hipsters dishing it out, without even a thank you."

She also gave us a nasty glare when Dawn M. asked if she could grind the coffee beans that we were about to purchase. In all fairness, the cafe mocha was excellent.

They have a small selection of pastries, and I get the olive oil short bread, which is essentially a healthier version of traditional short bread. It's sweet and short. Located on an isolated, one-way street, there are some organically-situated stone and wooden benches. They rest alongside flower beds where you can sit and enjoy your coffee, perhaps soaking in some sun. Cash only."

Geez, the way everyone talks about it around yelp, you'd think they had BBC dry out centers appointed by the courts. Based on my first and only experience, I was unimpressed. Frankly, I like it when somebody asks me my name or adds that extra special personable touch. I also don't mind paying above average prices for a great espresso. I don't feel that I got either at this place. A long line, with a cashier that had got a huge blue bottle coffee chip on her shoulder, and then a longer wait to get a super bitter shot of some mediocre tasting beans in a cup.My apologies to all those die hard BBC fans. I've had better."

These are one of the beverages I get when I need my daily caffeine fix.I came here today, purchased a bag of Blue Bottle Coffee branded Hayes Valley Espresso and Giant Steps Coffee Beans. Total for both bags are $16, I bought two 8 ounce bags of coffee beans of coffee beans so it was well worth the money. I'll definitely make a pit stop here the for a cup of Blue Bottle Coffee the next time I am in Hayes Valley. The service here is good and Blue Bottle Coffee is on my list of favorite coffee shop hot spots. I'm coming here when I feel like getting coffee at Blue Bottle. Downside, not a lot of seating.Driving?- Parking situations are similar to most areas here in San Francisco so good luck finding a spot to park your car in this area. Be prepared to have spare coins or an SFMTA Parking Meter Debit Card on you for the parking meters.Public Transit*:21 Hayes to Stanyan St (Golden Gate Park), get off on Hayes at Gough Streets*Highly recommended approach5/21/2014:- New Orleans Iced Coffee is a very tasty beverage. Two versions of this beverage are available: 1. Hand Crafted and 2. Carton Packaging (for on the go)- This location is definitely a garage based coffee shop (very unique) and also a neighborhood gem (treasure).- Seating maybe limited, but good coffee, good service and friendly baristas.- I noticed that they have adopted Square Payments now. Therefore, it looks like maybe credit/debit cards also acceptable forms of payments."

I had the awesome good fortune to stay near the kiosk location of Blue Bottle the last time I was in the city. At first I was hesitant about going there because of the hype surrounding the place. I decided to go ahead and give it a shot and I'm glad that I did. The TCHO mocha was the best mocha I've ever had, since the chocolate and coffee flavors were both well balanced and it wasn't too sugary. The regular latte was my usual order, as it was really yummy as well. The coffee flavor was assertive but not overbearing. It may be inconvenient to get to a Blue Bottle, but I will continue to make the effort whenever I'm in the city as long as the coffee is still that good."

I got a cool leaf design, which I haven't seen at my usual coffee stops. They also don't add the sugar for you, which is foreign to me.

But coffee, like wine, is an acquired taste and I am still waiting to love this coffee. My best experience was at their location in the Ferry Building. I found the 'secret window' thus avoiding most of the line and then you get to enjoy your coffee with that amazing view. This visit was fun because it is located in an alley. I thought for sure the map was wrong, then I saw the line. Kind of like a speakeasy for coffee. Hayes Valley is a great neighborhood so it is lovely to window shop while drinking your coffee, but of all the places I visited in S.F., this was the least enjoyable."

The coffee drinks themselves might be high brow, but there's nothing about the staff that creates a snobby vibe."

I got a pour-over in my travel mug, and an expensive bag of Sidamo for later ($11/8oz). Considering the line, I didn't ask what beans they were brewing, but it was an excellent cup: sweet and chocolatey, and not overboard with the acidity like a lot of the other cool coffee places. The folks behind the counter were friendly but efficient, chatting with the regulars without neglecting the drinks they were making.I rarely hand out that fifth star after a single visit, and I reserve the right to take it away if the espresso sucks, bur I doubt that'll happen.

I'm usually a mocha person, but don't care for the taste or the price at BB so I usually go for a cappuccino or a latte, although the ice coffee is absolutely delicious as well! I had a drip coffee once and was not a fan.The service is so/so. The baristas used to be much snobbier, but are either more relaxed now or are getting used to seeing me around. Don't expect a smile from them, but they make damn good coffee which is what counts. The baked goods are good too as an extra treat.As most others have mentioned, it is cash-only. There are days when I go to the ATM simply for the privilege of getting a Blue Bottle fix.They have \"seating\" in the alley in the form of rock benches, but it is technically a street, so cars can come by and nip at your toes.edit 6/2014: this review is now out-of-date! It's no longer cash-only, they can take cards now."

Something about getting your coffee from an alleyway makes it seem that much more legit (not shady at all). This time I got the soy mocha that so many people have been raving about. My initial reaction was \"$4.75 for a small mocha are you serious??\" Although it is on the pricier side, this has got to be my favorite cup of mocha I have ever had. The chocolate is from TCHO (a local sf chocolate company) and that made sense to why the mocha was so expensive (TCHO chocolate is EXPENSIVE)the design on top of the coffee was pretty cool too. it was in a leaf shape and I was impressed how effortlessly the barista did that.will I come here again? yes but the high price for coffee makes me not want to go here too often"

Even though we always had coffee in the house and at Frank's Deli (RIP), it was never fancy coffee.  To this day, my parents enjoy Taster's Choice the most.  When my mom comes out here and I try to take her somewhere notable, she'd rather have those individual packets of coffee already laced with cream and sugar from the Korean market.  While I don't drink it, I find it comforting that she's consistent.I am a bit more picky about coffee but it's the caffeine I really need.  The taste is almost secondary but I have to admit Blue Bottle is wonderful. The drip coffee, the iced lattes and the doggie treats Ishi enjoyed were great.  Unfortunately, the service is not always so pleasant and I like it better when people are nice to me."

But, thanks to my coworker's constant raving about blue bottle coffee and yelp, we decided to find a blue bottle coffee cafe.We searched out this little store front tucked away on a little street. Love the stand style of the cafe. Staff was friendly--I had originally asked for a \"Soy Iced Coffee\" and got a bit of a hesitant response from the person helping me. Then she suggested I get the Soy Iced New Orleans Coffee because adding soy to steamed coffee on ice makes it more bitter (i think that's what she said). Basically, I ordered a bad combo. Oops. I'm glad she spoke up because the New Orleans style (slow dripped) was pretty good. It reminded me of dark, dark chocolate. It was pretty sweet--which is the first I've ever tasted of a coffee.I was also expecting unusual caffeine attack after such a long hiatus, but I didnt get any. Woot!I still prefer my viet iced coffee over this, but I'm glad I got to try this type of coffee.EDIT: Just found out they're organic. BEST organic coffee I've had--all the previous ones I've had before tasted like cardboard. This is amazing in comparison! For that, one more star!"

(possibly user error)*  THE COFFEE.  Heh, the coffee.  I ordered a large coffee, black.  What I got was, marginally better than Foldgers.  It was very acidic and not very flavorful.  Starbucks blows this coffee out of the water, 10 fold.  And no, I am not a loyal Starbucks devotee! I had high hopes for this place, and I don't like giving bad reviews, but even if I rated this strictly on flavor alone, Blue Bottle barely would get 3 stars.  So why all the positive reviews?  Well, almost everyone I saw there was ordering Espresso, Capuccino, Americano, etc.  It's *possible* their Drip Coffee just sucks, any everything else is amazing.  I encourage you to make your own decision, and give them a try, especially if you aren't ordering black, drip coffee!  Please don't hate me for this review.  I am not a negative person, I do not like giving negative reviews.  This is just based 100% truthfully on my experience."

		"content": "Like others have said before, there isn't much more that I can add about how great Blue Bottle Coffee is. I usually buy their drip coffee as I am rapidly becoming a sort of coffee \"purist\" and although I am still an amateur coffee geek at best, I will say that they make some of the best drip coffee I've ever had. It is incredibly smooth, flavorful, and to me it is just the right temperature. I don't like scalding hot beverages although I know some people do enjoy their hot beverages that way. For those who don't enjoy their coffee black, I have also tried their cappuccino and New Orleans-style iced coffee and I can say with confidence that these are equally excellent. They also have an excellent selection of roasted beans for those who want to brew their own coffee at home with a variety of single origins as well as their own custom blends(which are quite good). As mentioned before by others, the baristas are very friendly and efficient. Now I would like to address something that has probably been addressed before here but I'll go ahead and address it anyway. I'd like to emphasize once again that I am no expert on coffee brewing and I am still learning but I can say that I probably know more than the average person. I've read some reviews where people found the coffee at Blue Bottle to be bland and lukewarm. While I heartily disagree I can see why Blue Bottle coffee may taste this way to some people. When brewing coffee, the three elements that are most important aside from the particular beans used are the grind, water temperature, and brewing time. If you use water that is too hot, you'll likely end up burning the coffee grounds and destroying the flavors. If you allow too little time for \"steeping\"(the part in which the coffee grounds are mixed with water) then you'll come out with bland, flavorless coffee. Allow the coffee to steep for too long and you'll have coffee that is much too bitter.  At Blue Bottle and other boutique coffee shops, the baristas closely monitor the temperature and steeping time of the coffee and probably use other methods of which I am unaware of in an effort to produce the smoothest and most flavorful cup of coffee. From what I can tell, it is the relative lack of bitterness in Blue Bottle Coffee that causes many to perceive Blue Bottle Coffee as \"smooth\" while some might perceive it to be \"bland.\" Also, the baristas here tend to brew coffee at a lower temperature than other places so as not to burn the beans. To an individual accustomed to coffee being scalding hot or at least close to it, the coffee at Blue Bottle might seem lukewarm in contrast. I'm also certain that since the baristas are humans and not robots programmed with advanced coffee brewing algorithms, they do mess up once in awhile and produce unsatisfactory cups of coffee. Anyway, I'd be surprised if you took the time to read all of that but either way, go and check this place out! Even if you don't end up liking the coffee, Hayes Valley is a cool little neighborhood."

The mix is light on the milk, at least compared with competing preparations, so the drinker is rewarded with a coffee taste that reminds you that BBCC makes the good stuff. And.. as I've discovered since making the leap from that gateway drug that is the soy-chai-tea-latte (guilty pleasure) to the leaded gasoline that is a coffee+milk drink, it helps that BBCC also serves treats to absorb the acidity. Yes, I'll pay $1 for a saffron snickerdoodle from Piccino's kitchen - it's worth every penny. Those go GREAT with cappuccino. Either that or the Bacon/Gruyere biscuit-like creation ($?), which is my alternative when they run out of cookies.

They asked me where I'd want to go, and I told them to lead the way, considering my knowledge of the city is more lacking than theirs. They named a few spots, including Blue Bottle, and I had remembered hearing good things about the place. So off we went to BB.We approached the literal hole-in-the-wall kiosk, which was interesting and unexpected. There was quite a line, but it moved fairly quickly, so I didn't take much notice. There were three efficient baristas working, with all three taking orders. A girl popped out from behind the counter, and while there were a good three or four people standing ahead, she made eye contact with us and asked for our orders. Apparently her hearing is of super power strength too, because we practically muttered our orders from where we were standing. Yet, she got everything easily.It didn't take long before our coffees were ready, and when I took the first sip of my soy latte, I was very pleasantly surprised. It was exceptionally smooth yet bold, and there was a tinge of sweetness despite the absence of sugar. The soy milk probably gave it the subtle sweet edge, and whatever type they used was pretty perfect.My soy latte was so good, that I actually finished the entire cup in a span of 15 minutes. This is a quite a feat for someone like myself who, for whatever reason, is the ultimate babysitter of drinks."

Every cup of coffee is delicious, and I love how they make each cup to order.  The Hayes location is my favorite because they offer soy milk and now have snacky snacks.  Another plus about Linden lane is they recently remodeled the street so the sidewalk is wide allowing for you to sit and enjoy.  The coffee is a more pricy than other places (it's $3.5 for ice coffee compared to $2 at standard locations) but I found it really worth it."

With the price they charge you for the beans, you get much better beans at House of Coffee on Noriega. I don't know if they roast their beans daily, like Henry at the House of Coffee does, but the staffs don't seem to know their beans fully. 2) Best iced coffee I've had. They add this \"chickory\" to their iced-coffee that makes it taste amazing, especially on a hot summer day at the ferry plaza farmer's market. 3) Good cappuccino. Very nice and creamy. A bit too creamy for my taste actually. If you like it creamy, place to go. 4) Hot chocolate. Very nice with the marshmallow from Recchiuti, so chewy but soft after soaked in the drink for a while. But I'm spoiled by the MarieBelle in NYC. This is just not as good.5) Latte like the cappuccino, nice and creamy.Overall it's a very neat place. I can see why people love it so much. The tiny booth that's artfully hidden in the alley of Hayes valley. Doesn't try too hard, which I like. I like the customers too that they just randomly sit on the ground, chat with each other, enjoy the coffee. I love the feeling of carelessness and randomness of the scene. Wondering where it is? You'll smell it when you are close, then the line will tell you where it is. We need more coffee shops like this so people know better, not to appreciate Starbucks. Just by thinking about starbucks makes me want to puke. Yuck!!Why 3 stars only. I'm just picky and spoiled by good food, especially when it comes to coffee and pastry."

I don't mind calling this emperor out on their lack of clothes; I found the coffee to be wholly unremarkable.Staff are efficient and courteous. Facility is clean; the \"fixin's table\" is well-appointed and tidy. Line moves slowly and the wait was always about 5-10 minutes before I could order. On a nice day, it's forgivable, as the garage is on a quiet side street and it's enjoyable to loiter (or \"stand about\").For a while, I went here with a friend that was a big fan of the place. I should mention that I prefer rich, smooth coffee (French-pressed medium roast all-Kona) but because of the cost and time involved, you can't find it in coffee shops; you must prepare it yourself. This makes me somewhat particular as to what shops I purchase from, as I've noticed a move towards stronger coffee in the city's non-chain coffee shops over the last two or three years.I only purchased coffee at Blue Bottle, not espresso, so I can only comment on same. Blue Bottle coffee tastes like a finely-ground dark roast, made with 2/3 the regular amount of water. Aroma is unremarkable; taste is rich and strong without being bitter and over-extracted; it is, however, a little astringent (\"gritty\") in the mouth. That texture is somewhat unavoidable in strong coffee; cream helps soften it. The coffee seems to be a dark roast, which I don't care for; about the best I can say is that it doesn't taste burned.The place didn't do anything for me except give me an excuse to leave the rat maze for 20 minutes on a nice day. If you like strong coffee, businesses operating out of garages, and/or hipsters, check it out."

I had always heard rumor of its excellent taste but was a bit skeptical as I have long been devoted to the brew of Philz Coffee. However, since Philz left its prime location next to the epic gathering place that locals city wide love- Dolores Park- Ive been searching for a new alternative. And so Ive found it. Blue Bottle Coffee in the Hayes Valley neck of the woods is located in an out of the way alley and draws an interesting assortment of people that characterizes what makes this city so great; we have the hip, the lesbians, thin framed glasses wearing baby boomer generation, and assortment of northern Europeans speaking barely recognizable languages, and of course everything else in between. Drawing this group together is the excellent coffee selected by Blue Bottle Coffee. They keep it simple. Keeping it simple works for them as the coffee is excellent and delightfully unadorned by a clusterf**k of seasonal teddy bears and silicon trivets. The coffee here will run you average to or less than average than most other spots in the City and is far better. Im looking forward to trying their new spot on top of the MoMA."

After all that, my cup of coffee was just alright. I think it was the Bella Donnovan blend. MEH. Muddy and flat. Perhaps that is why so many people in line ordered coffee drinks. I just like a good and simple cup of coffee. There is just too much fuss over this coffee.

No burnt tongues here!Their iced coffees are also great. A hint of chocolate, chicory, and cinnamon.

I didn't have any coffee in the house, and I had invited them over pretty early in the morning (before stores were open) so my game plan was to run over to Blue Bottle at like 7:30, pick up some coffee and run home.So I wake up, put on some clothes and mosey on over to Linden street. There wasn't too big of a line. I got right up to the front. The \"barista\" was this ornery looking, dark-haired (female) who eyed me once, said nothing and then preceeded to take 5 hours to make two lattes. Remember folks, I'm pressed for time. So I'm looking at the coffees, chillin' (though internally steaming, no pun intended) when FINALLY after FAR TOO LONG, (female) asks me how she can help me.So you coffee snobs out there are probs going to let out a tsk right about now but then again, you are coffee snobs... I don't have a coffee grinder. I used to have one, but then my boyfriend left me and took the grinder with him. (Okay, okay, it WAS his grinder). Anyway, fuck.

If you ask them to put the equivalent amount of ground coffee they would use to make you a cup of joe into a cup and then hand you the cup without adding water they WILL NOT satisfy your request. These people are ass-holes. (Very rude female) threw this at me in defense, \"Our beans are only ground SECONDS before they touch water!\" Oh yeah, (uncaring female)? How about I grind your punk face into that latte machine right this second! God. You know what? I'm sorry, Blue Bottle. Your coffee is great and all, but howsabout you pull that stick outta your ass and be a little nicer to people in a tight spot? Oh yeah, and fire that (inefficient female) you've got working for you.

But aside from the general employee attitude, there's nothing telling you what beans they're using for any drink on any given day.  I understand they may have some uneducated coffee drinkers who don't care, but please, for the rest of us, a small sign would suffice.  It's already insupportable enough that they don't have sizes or other things that make life pleasant for consumers; at least let us make educated decisions about what to order.In case you were wondering, I *would* like to just ask the baristas what I'm getting, but that's rarely an option, due to the fact that...2.  The service is bad.They're busy all the time.  I get it.  But there are simple ways of making customer experiences better even when you're overworked, like allowing customers to pay when they're ordering (thereby increasing facetime and allowing customers to ask questions close to the register, something they may not feel comfortable doing shouting from ten feet away).  It would also help if the baristas spent time with each customer, instead of chatting away with one or two people while shouting at customers further back.    (It would also also be nice to get a glimmer of recognition after the twentieth visit in thirty days, but sometimes that can be asking too much.)Aside from these two key points, I've had a lot of negative incidents where I've been ignored, brushed aside, made to wait while conversations were finished, and otherwise treated like a particularly obnoxious customer while waiting quietly for my drink.  I can understand this happening once or twice, but as I mentioned, I've got many a time since moving here and their attitude remains the same whether busy or slow, in the morning or near closing, and no matter who is working.  It's puzzling at best and infuriating at worse. I'll continue to give Blue Bottle my business since none of the other cafes around me have remotely good coffee. But I wish I didn't have to."

The coffee was good, but nothing like people had raved about.  The line was so long (to be expected during a festival) that we decided to puchase a bag of beans, so we wouldn't have to stand in line again.  When we asked what was being brewed the barrista had no clue (um, isn't that her job to know?) and recommended a roast. When we got home we were a bit disappointed in the bag of beans flavor. We were so dissappointed we threw it  away half empty.  To be fair, we currently use a blade grinder and just ordered a burr grinder, so hopefully that will make a difference for next time.Update 7/2/07:Bought another bag of coffee and one of the Beehouse drippers that they use at the Kiosk. The burr grinder made a huge improvement on taste and the dripper works well, but it's hard to get rid of the rude aftertaste of the barrista's out of my mind.  With coffee there's a lot to be said for customer service."

I didn't mind the line. Maybe it was because it was a Saturday afternoon and I was in no hurry to get anywhere. I didn't feel humiliated at the counter either - which seems to be a consistent gripe among many Yelp patrons. My barista was friendly and not condescending in the least. She looked tired, yes, but that was about it.My soy latte was a work of art. Yeah, yeah, the whole latte art make a leaf in the foam thing is cool, but they managed to do foam with soy milk that I've never seen anywhere else. The taste was amazing. So many baristas are half-hearted or unknowledgable about making good soy drinks, that it's hard not to be impressed. This seriously might just be the best soy latte I've ever had. We stood there by the counter and shared our little open-air ledge with a few other strangers and slowly appreciated our coffee. So the place isn't somewhere where you plop your butt down for hours so you can stare into your laptop. Who cares? There's enough of those joints in the City. You're outdoors, for the love of naan from Shalimar. And at least on this Saturday afternoon day, the outdoors were amazing.

		"content": "Blue Bottle coffee is hugely successful, they have lines down the alley constantly, and people will wait for half an hour to get a latte - and they have accomplished all this success even though they don't always give the customer everything they want. How is this possible? Because they actually care deeply about the quality of their product more than they care about honoring every silly request made by every customer who walks up. For this, they often get accused of being snobs, and I think this is just sad. What a shame that anyone who is not willing to compromise quality to please the masses is seen as arrogant. You can't both admit that the coffee is good and then fault them for doing the things that make it good, people.  What to know about Blue Bottle before you go:1) Yes, the wait can be long. Don't come here if you are in a hurry. There are plenty of other coffee places that can give you quick. Blue Bottle gives you delicious.2) They don't have flavors or silly ice cream drinks masquerading as coffee. 3) They will not grind your coffee. If you don't have a coffee grinder and are not wiling to spend $15 on one, take it to the grocery store and grind it there.  These guys are serious about freshness. They don't sell coffee beans more than 2 days after it was roasted. 4) There are no chairs or tables or wifi. They don't have a lot of pastries. This is not a cafe, it is a coffee stand.  If you want to sit and hang out, go somewhere else. 5) You should try the ginger scones. They are pricey, but worth it."

I don't mind waiting on line, but when I get to the counter I expect what I ordered. Beware of putting a tip in their huge tip jar before you receive your coffee, you might want it back after they mess up your order and then get mad at you for asking for what you really ordered. Seems fitting Blue Bottle is located in hyper-pretentious Hayes Valley. Their location on Polk Street closed almost immediately. I don't know why, but there are a lot better cafes all around them.

As a frequent customer (well. whenever I'm within a 20 block radius, I'll go), I've noticed the service vary. The quality of coffee doesn't change, but depending on the day and time of day your experience will vary. Baristas are very friendly most of the time, but there have been days where I've felt a bit snubbed by the service, so beware, but don't be too critical. If you were working and nobody bothered to tip or say thanks, wouldn't you be crabby?Still, doesn't affect the quality. ____________________________________I accidentally discovered Blue Bottle. Sure, I'd heard it's name whispered among well-learned coffee connoisseurs, but never thought much of it- I mean, how much 'better' could coffee get? A latte at Starbucks and a latte here would still be espresso and steamed milk, right? Well, to be cliche, wrong. My first trip here was when I cut through an alley to get to a store in Hayes Valley and noticed the small shop. The open garage door, the skinny table outside and the incredible amount of people just waiting for their drinks drew me and and I found myself in front of a smiling barista, who seemed more than happy to make me a soy latte and a small square of lemon shortbread from Miette. I walked for another block before I looked at the latte in my hand, a slight white paper cup and a flower made of steamed milk looking back at me. I sipped, sipped, and sipped again, and found myself in what I can only describe as one of the single greatest love affairs of this century: the latte wasn't just a drink- it was a work of art, carefully brewed and poured with precision. It was nothing short of wonderful (except, well, I think it'd be really cool if instead of plain cups, there'd be a small blue bottle on the cup somewhere..but that's just aesthetics for me). The coffee is great too- flavorful and bold, without making your taste buds cringe. The warm weather is coming so don't sell yourself short and say it's not 'coffee weather'. Their iced coffees are out of this world as well- phenomenal. Simply phenomenal."

Just like every 'gourmet' coffee place, they over-roast the beans. I like to have just plain espresso and you can really taste that OD on the roasting in an espresso. I know they make all their pulls ristretto which I like IF THE BEANS ARE NOT BURNED, but again, ristretto at Blue Bottle just tastes like a charred log.I think people rave about this place bc SF so desperately wants a 'great coffee place' to call its own, and heck, the name Blue Bottle sounds cute and catchy and Americana or something or other, and whatever. The beans are burned.And no dumb arguments about SF coffee being more smoky and whatnot. That is French Roast people, not espresso.Also, the two times I tried cappuccino here, well, I got a latte just like every dumb coffee place in SF. It is not just 1/3 espresso, 1/3 milk and 1/3 foam, all separate and stuff. The milk part has to be this kind of foamy milk melange that mixes a little w/ the espresso. Not bam, espresso up to here, then liquid milk up to here and the foam sitting on top. Take me to the Termini train station in Rome, the magazine stand near the platform that takes you to Paris. You can get the perfectestestest espresso in the world there for 90 cents. GOD SHOTS. I boycott American 'gourmet' coffee. If places like Blue Bottle would charge 90 cents instead of what $2 something for an espresso, then maybe I wouldn't complain.UPDATED:I got a message from someone who sent me info on BB's roasting processes. He was trying to explain that they don't burn their coffee. So it could be another reason why the espresso tastes charry:It is possible then that they may not burn their coffee. The problem then might be that the baristas are letting the water be in contact too long with the espresso grinds. That could be a result of tamping way too hard or the grind being too fine. So the water sits too long, extracting all the *bad* unpleasant bitterness and masking the *good* coffee bitterness :o). Which becomes especially noticeable in a ristretto shot.I am not sure if they have one of those machines that grinds, dispenses and tamps automatically. If that is the case then the dispensing and tamping are probably consistent, and the fineness of the grind is the variable. The grind for espresso should be checked regularly (more than once a day) because weird things like humidity affect it. I worked in coffee for about 8 years and learned all of this interesting (boring) stuff hehe."

I don't want to admit that I have gotten used to fair-good cup of coffee, but  this is quickly confirmed when tasting Blue Bottle. It is amazing and has a flavor like no other coffee I have tried. Can I describe it? Not really but I can say it is worth the rain, the plane delays (compliments of Jet Blue) and the line at the small coffee counter. I used to believe that the coffee at Kings Road Cafe in Los Angeles was the best I have ever had, but now I am in love with Blue Bottle. New Yorkers love to hate California. I am not one of them. Thank you California for your casual but smart attitude, your quirky good nature and your damn good coffee. Now you New Yorkers, please drop the attitude, hop on a plane and go to the best city in the country. And don't forget to stop in Hayes Valley, drink some coffee and recognize  the worth of that YES that is accentuated in their neighborhood banners."

I try to not complain in reviews b/c I don't find it very helpful, but today I really need to comment.Coffee: Overall, very good, very fresh, very strong. I only tried the drip coffee; I'm curious how I might like a frothy specialty coffee. 3.5 stars for the coffee.  Baristas: Were overall professional, and after we asked why people who ordered after us were getting their lattes before us, they explained it takes longer for drip and apologized for the wait. Ambiance: I knew this was nothing more than a kiosk, so wasn't expecting much w.r.t. decor. But, from the moment we walked up, I felt uneasy and tense. The energy here on a Saturday morning was not good. The customers all seemed aggressive in a \"I-come-here-all-the-time-who-the-f*ck-are-you\" for this \"super hip awesome\" place...or maybe they were all in severe caffeine withdrawal. Like the yuppie couple behind me who kept pushing against me (I'm a yuppie too, but I still know about personal space and queue etiquette- like, back the f*ck off, lady), the odd woman who parked herself by the counter while drinking her coffee, to the man who walked up to the counter, w/o waiting in line, and wouldn't move so that my brother and I both had to reach over him to get our lids and sugar. All this culminated in a woman walking up to aforementioned man and yelling and calling him an \"inconsiderate asshole\" for hitting her car. Turns out she works at Blue Bottle! Niiiice.I understand now, after having read a bunch of the reviews, that there is clearly a sense of entitlement to this place. I'm new to SF and still exploring. I'm looking forward to the day I feel a similar sense of smugness for a local coffee place and have no qualms about being incredibly rude and inconsiderate to my fellow customers. Will I go back: Hmmm...maybe but not on a Saturday. I'm actually really interested in checking out the cafe with the $20k coffee machine that is supposed to create coffee from the heavens..."

That being said, almost any good coffee establishment does one aspect \"the best.\" I've always loved Blue Bottle, as they opened my world to the difference between freshly roasted coffee and... everything else. But, for sure, they have the most bomb-ass iced coffee. The way that they make it is a truly unique method, with chicory root and a whole lotta lovin.

In the morning the barista slides open what appears to be a garage door and the most fantastic smell of fresh roasted beans wafts out of the unassuming kiosk. The baristas are true blue-blooded coffee snobs. They will laugh at you smugly if you ask them to grind your coffee; they will scorn your Mr Coffee, and will call your mokka pot fickle, but will be happy to engage in a lengthy discussion about the merits of the vacuum brewer--regardless of how long the line is.  The beans are roasted fresh and they won't sell you beans that were roasted more than 48 hours ago.  Even if you beg.  The coffee is divine. The drip coffee is made by the cup in a ceramic dripper. It's caramelly, nutty and complex. The lattes are made with organic clover milk are finished with an expert leaf pattern. If you buy beans I recommend the Chiapas for a cozy companion to Sunday brunch and the Hayes Valley Espresso for your weekday am commute. I've been told it's addiction but I think it of it as affection."

My double was rich and delicious.The service was friendly and expedient (especially considering that the coffee is made by hand, not robots). I was, however, thankful for a warm jacket while waiting outside on a cold winter morning.The bean selection was a bit limited in the morning, but they had a few more choices when I returned at lunch time.

My school of thought with most everything is \"if this one pill makes me feel like this then imagine what five will make me feel like.\" Substitute pill with your substance or food of choice and this explains why I am on the diet. Well, today I allowed myself caffeine for the first time and I did it with style. One cup of coffee from Blue Bottle and it was amazing. It is now the yardstick with which I will measure all others. Each cup is made individually using the drip technique which gives it a richer bolder taste. So much so that I wouldn't bring a coffee novice here. It would be similar to giving someone a bottle of really expensive, really dry red wine as their first taste. When in actuality they should start with Boone's Farm.

When I finally did get to the front and got my small cap, I was shaking with excitement (or maybe it was caffeine withdrawal). I saw that this place, in addition to the pelthora of 5 stars here, is rated #2 in the city on coffeeratings.com. My fave - Martha Brothers - is only #35 there, so I have lots of coffee drinking to do! So, I got the cap and was a little disheartened to find that there was no splenda, or any sweetener alternative. Just regular sugar. I decided to taste it sans sweetener. It really is a good cup. It didn't need sugar. It smells nice and is smooth and easy to drink. In the end, though, I missed the more \"roasty\" flavors I find in Martha's and even Progressive grounds (to a lesser extent). I agree with one of the reviewers below: Nothing wrong with this place, but it doesn't really stand out for me. There weren't any pastry items to speak of (except macaroons, which I don't call a pastry item, really), and the cup was $4 for a small. I won't be going out of my way to this location, but if they opened one closer to Bernal/Mission/Noe I may stop in from time to time."
