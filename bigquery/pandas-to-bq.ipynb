After your pick up your delicious Mocha (my fave), you can walk around the corner to a gluten free French macaroon shop or go shopping at all the fun boutiques in the area.

The next-to-none parking shouldn't factor into a review for this shop, because parking in the whole city is awful.

I always thought they were the French and Italian versions of the same thing.

Seeing as I was at Blue Bottle, it seemed a horrific waste to buy milk but it was morning so I opted for the $4 Cafe au Lait. It looked like a latte with a foamy top but it was delightful deliciousness. Like the perfect amount of coffee and milk married together in creamy harmony. I sat in the tiny park across the way and watched an even tinier mouse gather food and take it to it's tiny underground nest. By the time my friend joined me, a huge line had formed. 9 AM seems to be the tipping point on a Saturday morning. We lined up to get her a coffee and I ended up getting ANOTHER one! It was so good.

My hand shook carrying it over to the car for the others to see before capping it, which was quite the challenge but this beauty needed to be appreciated.

Pete's coffee is on par, and more flavorful in my opinion. I couldn't taste the minuscule difference this place is supposed to have for all the positive reviews. Fanfare around the city's trendy hotspots is really getting to be like the emperor's new clothes for me, all hype with little substance. So for just this level of coffee and price, I feel they should at least provide some place to sit down, but most of Blue Bottles are savvy on space and high traffic. Not worth the price (and the slight snobby service I detected) this morning. There's no bright customer service, just disaffected hipsters dishing it out, without even a thank you.\",\n",

Your hipster setup does not impress me.3. The SERVICE. The cashier was snobbish. She made us feel quite stupid for not knowing that it was cash only. She also gave us a nasty glare when Dawn M. asked if she could grind the coffee beans that we were about to purchase. In all fairness, the cafe mocha was excellent. It was creamy and had a rich chocolate flavor. The olive oil shortbread was tasty. Olive oil on a sweet pastry?

But, thanks to my coworker\\'s constant raving about blue bottle coffee and yelp, we decided to find a blue bottle coffee cafe.We searched out this little store front tucked away on a little street. Love the stand style of the cafe. Staff was friendly--I had originally asked for a \"Soy Iced Coffee\" and got a bit of a hesitant response from the person helping me. Then she suggested I get the Soy Iced New Orleans Coffee because adding soy to steamed coffee on ice makes it more bitter (i think that\\'s what she said). Basically, I ordered a bad combo. Oops. I\\'m glad she spoke up because the New Orleans style (slow dripped) was pretty good. It reminded me of dark, dark chocolate. It was pretty sweet--which is the first I\\'ve ever tasted of a coffee.I was also expecting unusual caffeine attack after such a long hiatus, but I didnt get any. Woot!I still prefer my viet iced coffee over this, but I\\'m glad I got to try this type of coffee.EDIT: Just found out they\\'re organic.

       "  {u'content': u'Like others have said before, there isn\\'t much more that I can add about how great Blue Bottle Coffee is. I usually buy their drip coffee as I am rapidly becoming a sort of coffee \"purist\" and although I am still an amateur coffee geek at best, I will say that they make some of the best drip coffee I\\'ve ever had. It is incredibly smooth, flavorful, and to me it is just the right temperature. I don\\'t like scalding hot beverages although I know some people do enjoy their hot beverages that way. For those who don\\'t enjoy their coffee black, I have also tried their cappuccino and New Orleans-style iced coffee and I can say with confidence that these are equally excellent. They also have an excellent selection of roasted beans for those who want to brew their own coffee at home with a variety of single origins as well as their own custom blends(which are quite good). As mentioned before by others, the baristas are very friendly and efficient. Now I would like to address something that has probably been addressed before here but I\\'ll go ahead and address it anyway. I\\'d like to emphasize once again that I am no expert on coffee brewing and I am still learning but I can say that I probably know more than the average person. I\\'ve read some reviews where people found the coffee at Blue Bottle to be bland and lukewarm. While I heartily disagree I can see why Blue Bottle coffee may taste this way to some people. When brewing coffee, the three elements that are most important aside from the particular beans used are the grind, water temperature, and brewing time. If you use water that is too hot, you\\'ll likely end up burning the coffee grounds and destroying the flavors. If you allow too little time for \"steeping\"(the part in which the coffee grounds are mixed with water) then you\\'ll come out with bland, flavorless coffee. Allow the coffee to steep for too long and you\\'ll have coffee that is much too bitter. \\xa0At Blue Bottle and other boutique coffee shops, the baristas closely monitor the temperature and steeping time of the coffee and probably use other methods of which I am unaware of in an effort to produce the smoothest and most flavorful cup of coffee. From what I can tell, it is the relative lack of bitterness in Blue Bottle Coffee that causes many to perceive Blue Bottle Coffee as \"smooth\" while some might perceive it to be \"bland.\" Also, the baristas here tend to brew coffee at a lower temperature than other places so as not to burn the beans. To an individual accustomed to coffee being scalding hot or at least close to it, the coffee at Blue Bottle might seem lukewarm in contrast. I\\'m also certain that since the baristas are humans and not robots programmed with advanced coffee brewing algorithms, they do mess up once in awhile and produce unsatisfactory cups of coffee. Anyway, I\\'d be surprised if you took the time to read all of that but either way, go and check this place out! Even if you don\\'t end up liking the coffee, Hayes Valley is a cool little neighborhood.',\n",

       "  {u'content': u\"As part of my inadvertent SF coffee tour, my friend and her husband wanted to grab something warm before setting out on the chilly day. They asked me where I'd want to go, and I told them to lead the way, considering my knowledge of the city is more lacking than theirs. They named a few spots, including Blue Bottle, and I had remembered hearing good things about the place. So off we went to BB.We approached the literal hole-in-the-wall kiosk, which was interesting and unexpected. There was quite a line, but it moved fairly quickly, so I didn't take much notice. There were three efficient baristas working, with all three taking orders. A girl popped out from behind the counter, and while there were a good three or four people standing ahead, she made eye contact with us and asked for our orders. Apparently her hearing is of super power strength too, because we practically muttered our orders from where we were standing. Yet, she got everything easily.It didn't take long before our coffees were ready, and when I took the first sip of my soy latte, I was very pleasantly surprised. It was exceptionally smooth yet bold, and there was a tinge of sweetness despite the absence of sugar. The soy milk probably gave it the subtle sweet edge, and whatever type they used was pretty perfect.My soy latte was so good, that I actually finished the entire cup in a span of 15 minutes. This is a quite a feat for someone like myself who, for whatever reason, is the ultimate babysitter of drinks.\",\n",

I don\\'t mind calling this emperor out on their lack of clothes; I found the coffee to be wholly unremarkable.Staff are efficient and courteous. Facility is clean; the \"fixin\\'s table\" is well-appointed and tidy. Line moves slowly and the wait was always about 5-10 minutes before I could order.

I should mention that I prefer rich, smooth coffee (French-pressed medium roast all-Kona) but because of the cost and time involved, you can\\'t find it in coffee shops; you must prepare it yourself. This makes me somewhat particular as to what shops I purchase from, as I\\'ve noticed a move towards stronger coffee in the city\\'s non-chain coffee shops over the last two or three years.I only purchased coffee at Blue Bottle, not espresso, so I can only comment on same. Blue Bottle coffee tastes like a finely-ground dark roast, made with 2/3 the regular amount of water. Aroma is unremarkable; taste is rich and strong without being bitter and over-extracted; it is, however, a little astringent (\"gritty\") in the mouth. That texture is somewhat unavoidable in strong coffee; cream helps soften it. The coffee seems to be a dark roast, which I don\\'t care for; about the best I can say is that it doesn\\'t taste burned.The place didn\\'t do anything for me except give me an excuse to leave the rat maze for 20 minutes on a nice day.

Blue Bottle Coffee in the Hayes Valley neck of the woods is located in an out of the way alley and draws an interesting assortment of people that characterizes what makes this city so great; we have the hip, the lesbians, thin framed glasses wearing baby boomer generation, and assortment of northern Europeans speaking barely recognizable languages, and of course everything else in between. Drawing this group together is the excellent coffee selected by Blue Bottle Coffee. They keep it simple. Keeping it simple works for them as the coffee is excellent and delightfully unadorned by a clusterf**k of seasonal teddy bears and silicon trivets. The coffee here will run you average to or less than average than most other spots in the City and is far better. Im looking forward to trying their new spot on top of the MoMA.',\n",

There wasn\\'t too big of a line. I got right up to the front.

I don\\'t have a coffee grinder. I used to have one, but then my boyfriend left me and took the grinder with him. (Okay, okay, it WAS his grinder). Anyway, fuck. I haven\\'t had the time or the desire to pick up another one, and most places are kind enough to grind your coffee for you.NOT BLUE BOTTLENot only will Blue Bottle NOT grind your coffee for you. If you ask them for a 1/2 pound of the coffee they\\'re grinding that morning, they WILL NOT sell it to you. If you ask them to put the equivalent amount of ground coffee they would use to make you a cup of joe into a cup and then hand you the cup without adding water they WILL NOT satisfy your request. These people are ass-holes. (Very rude female) threw this at me in defense, \"Our beans are only ground SECONDS before they touch water!\" Oh yeah, (uncaring female)? How about I grind your punk face into that latte machine right this second! God. You know what? I\\'m sorry, Blue Bottle. Your coffee is great and all, but howsabout you pull that stick outta your ass and be a little nicer to people in a tight spot?

       "  {u'content': u\"Blue Bottle coffee is hugely successful, they have lines down the alley constantly, and people will wait for half an hour to get a latte - and they have accomplished all this success even though they don't always give the customer everything they want. How is this possible? Because they actually care deeply about the quality of their product more than they care about honoring every silly request made by every customer who walks up. For this, they often get accused of being snobs, and I think this is just sad. What a shame that anyone who is not willing to compromise quality to please the masses is seen as arrogant. You can't both admit that the coffee is good and then fault them for doing the things that make it good, people. \\xa0What to know about Blue Bottle before you go:1) Yes, the wait can be long. Don't come here if you are in a hurry. There are plenty of other coffee places that can give you quick. Blue Bottle gives you delicious.2) They don't have flavors or silly ice cream drinks masquerading as coffee. 3) They will not grind your coffee. If you don't have a coffee grinder and are not wiling to spend $15 on one, take it to the grocery store and grind it there. \\xa0These guys are serious about freshness. They don't sell coffee beans more than 2 days after it was roasted. 4) There are no chairs or tables or wifi. They don't have a lot of pastries. This is not a cafe, it is a coffee stand. \\xa0If you want to sit and hang out, go somewhere else. 5) You should try the ginger scones. They are pricey, but worth it.\",\n",

I mainly go to Blue Bottle to buy beans, and brew at home, but of course get myself an espresso to sip in the alley, and bring the experience full circle.

Purists yes, but never patronizing.I, too, wish they had seating, but I\\'m so focused on getting my coffee I\\'m never bothered by the elements nor the alley.

As a frequent customer (well. whenever I'm within a 20 block radius, I'll go), I've noticed the service vary. The quality of coffee doesn't change, but depending on the day and time of day your experience will vary. Baristas are very friendly most of the time, but there have been days where I've felt a bit snubbed by the service, so beware, but don't be too critical. If you were working and nobody bothered to tip or say thanks, wouldn't you be crabby?Still, doesn't affect the quality. ____________________________________I accidentally discovered Blue Bottle. Sure, I'd heard it's name whispered among well-learned coffee connoisseurs, but never thought much of it- I mean, how much 'better' could coffee get? A latte at Starbucks and a latte here would still be espresso and steamed milk, right? Well, to be cliche, wrong. My first trip here was when I cut through an alley to get to a store in Hayes Valley and noticed the small shop. The open garage door, the skinny table outside and the incredible amount of people just waiting for their drinks drew me and and I found myself in front of a smiling barista, who seemed more than happy to make me a soy latte and a small square of lemon shortbread from Miette. I walked for another block before I looked at the latte in my hand, a slight white paper cup and a flower made of steamed milk looking back at me. I sipped, sipped, and sipped again, and found myself in what I can only describe as one of the single greatest love affairs of this century: the latte wasn't just a drink- it was a work of art, carefully brewed and poured with precision. It was nothing short of wonderful (except, well, I think it'd be really cool if instead of plain cups, there'd be a small blue bottle on the cup somewhere..but that's just aesthetics for me). The coffee is great too- flavorful and bold, without making your taste buds cringe. The warm weather is coming so don't sell yourself short and say it's not 'coffee weather'. Their iced coffees are out of this world as well- phenomenal. Simply phenomenal.\",\n",

       "  {u'content': u\"I dunno...everyone raves about the coffee here. I think I am just going to stop drinking coffee in the US and save all my caffeine highs for trips to Europe. Just like every 'gourmet' coffee place, they over-roast the beans. I like to have just plain espresso and you can really taste that OD on the roasting in an espresso. I know they make all their pulls ristretto which I like IF THE BEANS ARE NOT BURNED, but again, ristretto at Blue Bottle just tastes like a charred log.I think people rave about this place bc SF so desperately wants a 'great coffee place' to call its own, and heck, the name Blue Bottle sounds cute and catchy and Americana or something or other, and whatever. The beans are burned.And no dumb arguments about SF coffee being more smoky and whatnot. That is French Roast people, not espresso.Also, the two times I tried cappuccino here, well, I got a latte just like every dumb coffee place in SF. It is not just 1/3 espresso, 1/3 milk and 1/3 foam, all separate and stuff. The milk part has to be this kind of foamy milk melange that mixes a little w/ the espresso. Not bam, espresso up to here, then liquid milk up to here and the foam sitting on top. Take me to the Termini train station in Rome, the magazine stand near the platform that takes you to Paris. You can get the perfectestestest espresso in the world there for 90 cents. GOD SHOTS. I boycott American 'gourmet' coffee. If places like Blue Bottle would charge 90 cents instead of what $2 something for an espresso, then maybe I wouldn't complain.UPDATED:I got a message from someone who sent me info on BB's roasting processes. He was trying to explain that they don't burn their coffee. So it could be another reason why the espresso tastes charry:It is possible then that they may not burn their coffee. The problem then might be that the baristas are letting the water be in contact too long with the espresso grinds. That could be a result of tamping way too hard or the grind being too fine. So the water sits too long, extracting all the *bad* unpleasant bitterness and masking the *good* coffee bitterness :o). Which becomes especially noticeable in a ristretto shot.I am not sure if they have one of those machines that grinds, dispenses and tamps automatically. If that is the case then the dispensing and tamping are probably consistent, and the fineness of the grind is the variable. The grind for espresso should be checked regularly (more than once a day) because weird things like humidity affect it. I worked in coffee for about 8 years and learned all of this interesting (boring) stuff hehe.\",\n",

Also, the New Orleans iced coffee is incredible especially on a hot day. They sweeten it with a little chicory and it's truly perfect. It's really popular so the lines are outrageous but it's worth the wait.\",\n",

But let me tell you, here in New York, I am not convinced that anyone knows a great cup of coffee. Yes, I have given positive reviews to my neighborhood coffee shops but I do so a bit begrudgingly. I don't want to admit that I have gotten used to fair-good cup of coffee, but \\xa0this is quickly confirmed when tasting Blue Bottle. It is amazing and has a flavor like no other coffee I have tried. Can I describe it? Not really but I can say it is worth the rain, the plane delays (compliments of Jet Blue) and the line at the small coffee counter. I used to believe that the coffee at Kings Road Cafe in Los Angeles was the best I have ever had, but now I am in love with Blue Bottle. New Yorkers love to hate California. I am not one of them. Thank you California for your casual but smart attitude, your quirky good nature and your damn good coffee. Now you New Yorkers, please drop the attitude, hop on a plane and go to the best city in the country. And don't forget to stop in Hayes Valley, drink some coffee and recognize \\xa0the worth of that YES that is accentuated in their neighborhood banners.\",\n",

       "  {u'content': u'After 2 mentions this week (NYT and Daily Candy), my brother and I decided to give this place a try. I try to not complain in reviews b/c I don\\'t find it very helpful, but today I really need to comment.Coffee: Overall, very good, very fresh, very strong. I only tried the drip coffee; I\\'m curious how I might like a frothy specialty coffee. 3.5 stars for the coffee. \\xa0Baristas: Were overall professional, and after we asked why people who ordered after us were getting their lattes before us, they explained it takes longer for drip and apologized for the wait. Ambiance: I knew this was nothing more than a kiosk, so wasn\\'t expecting much w.r.t. decor. But, from the moment we walked up, I felt uneasy and tense. The energy here on a Saturday morning was not good. The customers all seemed aggressive in a \"I-come-here-all-the-time-who-the-f*ck-are-you\" for this \"super hip awesome\" place...or maybe they were all in severe caffeine withdrawal. Like the yuppie couple behind me who kept pushing against me (I\\'m a yuppie too, but I still know about personal space and queue etiquette- like, back the f*ck off, lady), the odd woman who parked herself by the counter while drinking her coffee, to the man who walked up to the counter, w/o waiting in line, and wouldn\\'t move so that my brother and I both had to reach over him to get our lids and sugar. All this culminated in a woman walking up to aforementioned man and yelling and calling him an \"inconsiderate asshole\" for hitting her car. Turns out she works at Blue Bottle! Niiiice.I understand now, after having read a bunch of the reviews, that there is clearly a sense of entitlement to this place. I\\'m new to SF and still exploring. I\\'m looking forward to the day I feel a similar sense of smugness for a local coffee place and have no qualms about being incredibly rude and inconsiderate to my fellow customers. Will I go back: Hmmm...maybe but not on a Saturday. I\\'m actually really interested in checking out the cafe with the $20k coffee machine that is supposed to create coffee from the heavens...',\n",

The drip coffee is made by the cup in a ceramic dripper. It's caramelly, nutty and complex. The lattes are made with organic clover milk are finished with an expert leaf pattern.

       "  {u'content': u'I was in Hayes Valley to pick up a check, and had to see what all the fuss is about. I stood in line behind some dude (who ordered up about all the inventory in the place) for about 5 minutes, impatiently checking my watch and looking over my shoulder back towards Gough, imagining that my unplugged meter was resulting in a ticket and an unintented $40+ capuchino. When I finally did get to the front and got my small cap, I was shaking with excitement (or maybe it was caffeine withdrawal). I saw that this place, in addition to the pelthora of 5 stars here, is rated #2 in the city on coffeeratings.com. My fave - Martha Brothers - is only #35 there, so I have lots of coffee drinking to do! So, I got the cap and was a little disheartened to find that there was no splenda, or any sweetener alternative. Just regular sugar. I decided to taste it sans sweetener. It really is a good cup. It didn\\'t need sugar. It smells nice and is smooth and easy to drink. In the end, though, I missed the more \"roasty\" flavors I find in Martha\\'s and even Progressive grounds (to a lesser extent). I agree with one of the reviewers below: Nothing wrong with this place, but it doesn\\'t really stand out for me. There weren\\'t any pastry items to speak of (except macaroons, which I don\\'t call a pastry item, really), and the cup was $4 for a small. I won\\'t be going out of my way to this location, but if they opened one closer to Bernal/Mission/Noe I may stop in from time to time.',\n",
