    "## Project Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll learn how to use the [Google Cloud Speech API](https://cloud.google.com/speech/) to transcribe an audio file. The trickiest part of this API is converting your audio data into the correct format, which we'll do using [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "[YouTube Audio Library](https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/music) has a number of public domain audio files. The audio file transcribed in this tutorial was downloaded from that library (by searching \"speech\" in the search box).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Audio longer than 1 minute must reside on Google Cloud Storage [[usage limit]](https://cloud.google.com/speech/limits).** Since most audio files would be longer than 1 minute, we'll skip the part where files could be transcribed locally and instead we'll learn how to transcribe files on Google Cloud Storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "### I. Google Cloud Platform (GCP) credentials:\n",
    "   * If you haven't already, you may sign-up for the [free GCP trial credit](https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/frequently-asked-questions)\n",
    "   * [Set up your project](https://cloud.google.com/speech/docs/getting-started#set_up_your_project) on GCP and enable the Speech API\n",
    "\n",
    "### II. Spin-up a VM instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Transcribing an audio file on Google Cloud Storage requires a VM instance. It's lengthy, but simple, to start an instance and install all the necessary packages on it!\n",
    "   1. [Create a VM instance](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/quickstart-linux#create_a_virtual_machine_instance)\n",
    "       * Select **Ubuntu** under 'Boot disk'\n",
    "       * '**Allow full access to all Cloud APIs**' under 'Access scopes'\n",
    "   2. [Connect to your VM instance](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/quickstart-linux#connect_to_your_instance)\n",
    "   \n",
    "### III. Install packages on your VM:\n",
    "   \n",
    "#### 1. Install FFmpeg:  \n",
    "`$ sudo apt-get install`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Install pip:\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "$ sudo apt-get install python-pip python-dev build-essential\n",
    "$ sudo pip install --upgrade pip\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Install the Speech API Python library:  \n",
    "`$ pip install google-cloud-speech==0.27.1`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Install [gcsfuse](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/gcsfuse/blob/master/docs/installing.md):\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "$ sudo apt-get install lsb-release\n",
    "$ export GCSFUSE_REPO=gcsfuse-`lsb_release -c -s`\n",
    "$ echo \"deb http://packages.cloud.google.com/apt $GCSFUSE_REPO main\" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/gcsfuse.list\n",
    "$ curl https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | sudo apt-key add -\n",
    "$ sudo apt-get update\n",
    "$ sudo apt-get install gcsfuse\n",
    "```\n",
